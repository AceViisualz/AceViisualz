## Hi there 👋

I’m Adam, a Software Engineer based in the United States.

I design and build projects that bring my ideas to life. When an idea pops into my head, I usually build it and ship it.

My main tech stack includes C++, C, and Python. Some of my favorite tools are VS Code and Git.

I have several pinned projects, but my personal favorite is Tic-Tac-Toe. I’ve built over 10 public reports, and likely more than 20 privately.

**Fun Facts**
- I have a cat 
- I don’t like dark coffee
- Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
- Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
